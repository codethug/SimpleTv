# Simple.TV Downloader

If you have a [Simple.TV](https:/www.simple.tv) and want to copy your recordings from your Simple.TV, this project
is for you.  When run, SimpleTV Downloader will download all recordings to a directory you specify.  Use it like this:

`SimpleTv.Downloader.exe -u username@somewhere.com -p "P@ssw0Rd" -d c:\tvshows`

The downloader names the files intelligently and files them in a folder per show.  By default, the folder and file naming is [Plex friendly](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/200220687-Naming-Series-Season-Based-TV-Shows).

Thanks to jschwalbe for [his bookmarklet](http://community.simple.tv/index.php?/topic/953-download-video-files-with-this-new-bookmarklet/?hl=download) which both inspired me to write Simple.TV Downloader and showed me how to format a URL so that a show can be downloaded.
